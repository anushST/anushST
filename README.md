## 💡 About Me
Python backend developer with 4 years of commercial experience, working in teams of 2 to 30 members in both on-site and remote settings. I have built the full development cycle—from gathering product-owner requirements to a fully automated release process with high test coverage, in-depth analytics, and CI/CD.  
I establish rapport easily, take ownership of tasks, and enjoy tackling tough challenges. I also have a solid background in mathematics, physics, economics, and investing.
